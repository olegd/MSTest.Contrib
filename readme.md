MSTest.Contrib
==============

Extensions to MSTest framework with additional assertion methods that would bring more joy to unit testing.

Implemented improvements:
-----------------

    
    Assert.Throws<T>(Action action, string exceptionMessageShouldContain = null)

    Assert.That(object actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))
